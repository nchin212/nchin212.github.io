      <description>Credit card companies handle numerous credit card transactions each day and there could be some cases of fraudulent transactions, where customers are charged for items they did not purchase. As such, it is important for companies to detect these fraudulent transactions to improve customer security and build up customer confidence in the company. In this project, we will explore some methods to resolve data imbalance and use logistic regression to classify the transactions as safe or fraudulent.</description>

      <description>Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics. This is essential as it allows companies to market to each group effectively and appropriately. By marketing to each customer group differently, companies will be able to maximise their profits. To perform customer segmentation, we will be performing recency, frequency and monetary (RFM) analysis, followed by k-means clustering.
Data The data contains various items purchased by various customers across 38 countries.</description>

      <description>Around the world, people are spending an increasing amount of time on their mobile devices for email, social networking, banking and a whole range of other activities. But typing on mobile devices can be a serious pain. The goal of this project is to learn and build predictive text models in R.
This project was done as part of the Johns Hopkins University Data Science Capstone Project. In this project, the stupid backoff algorithm will be used to build a predictive text model.</description>
