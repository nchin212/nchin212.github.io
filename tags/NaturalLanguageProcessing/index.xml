      <description>In this project, we analyzed Amazon video game reviews by classifying them as positive or negative. We tokenized the reviews using 2 different vectorizers, CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer. We then applied naive bayes, logistic regression and support vector machine (SVM) on the 2 different vectorizers. Naive Bayes with CountVectorizer had the highest f1-score of around 88%.</description>

      <description>In this project, we created an application that predicts the next word based on the user&amp;rsquo;s input words and achieved an accuracy score of 68%. We first combined text from US blogs, news and twitter and used quanteda to tokenize the text to 1gram, 2grams and 3grams. The stupid backoff algorithm was applied to compute scores for each word and the word with the highest score would be the next predicted word.</description>
