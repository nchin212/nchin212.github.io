      <description>Sentiment Analysis is a natural language processing technique used to determine whether the data is positive, negative or neutral. It helps companies monitor brand and product reputation and gauge customer sentiments on their products from customer reviews. In this project, we will be examining Amazon reviews for video games and using naive bayes, logistic regression and support vector machines for sentiment analysis. We will also be comparing between 2 tokenization techniques, CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer in scikit-learn.</description>

      <description>Credit card companies handle numerous credit card transactions each day and there could be some cases of fraudulent transactions, where customers are charged for items they did not purchase. As such, it is important for companies to detect these fraudulent transactions to improve customer security and build up customer confidence in the company. In this project, we will explore some methods to resolve data imbalance and use logistic regression to classify the transactions as safe or fraudulent.</description>
