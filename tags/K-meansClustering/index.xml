      <description>Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics. This is essential as it allows companies to market to each group effectively and appropriately. Instead of analysing the entire customer base as a whole, it is better for companies to segment them into homogeneous groups, understand the traits of each group, and engage them with relevant campaigns rather than segmenting on just customer age or geography.</description>
